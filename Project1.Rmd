## Loading and Preprocessing data

The following code serves to load the activity data

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = T)
activity[,2] <- as.Date(activity$date)

#Setting up Environment
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

We'll start by grouping our data by date, and then plotting the total number of steps per day in a histogram

```{r}
activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(perDay = sum(steps)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(perDay)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15) + 
  ggtitle("Total steps per day") +
  xlab("Steps Per Day") + ylab("Frequency")
```
